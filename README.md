# Facial-emotion-recognition-system
Built a facial emotion recognition system that identified emotions images of human faces. Used a labeled dataset: FER-2013 from Kaagle which contained label images of facial expressions. I preprocessed the images, trained a convolutional neural network (CNN), and evaluate the model's accuracy in classifying emotions.
