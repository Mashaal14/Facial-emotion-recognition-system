# Facial-emotion-recognition-system
Built a facial emotion recognition system that identified emotions images of human faces. Used a labeled dataset: FER-2013 from Kaagle which contained label images of facial expressions. I preprocessed the images, trained a convolutional neural network (CNN), and evaluate the model's accuracy in classifying emotions. 

# Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN üé≠ü§ñ  

This project implements a **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the FER-2013 dataset. The model classifies grayscale facial images (48x48) into seven emotion categories**:  

- Angry  
- Disgust  
- Fear  
- Happy  
- Sad  
- Surprise  
- Neutral
